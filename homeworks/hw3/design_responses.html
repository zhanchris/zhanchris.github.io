							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the importance of text, and the primary tenets of textual design. 
								Purpose is important since it tells us what information we want to convey. 
								Audience is important as it changes how we think about designing our text.
								Font selection is also important since different fonts convey different meanings.
							</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed the various examples the article provided for how fonts are used in 
								contrasting manners. It gave me a good idea of how typography changes depending on our context.
								The examples also gave me some design inspiration for when I eventually put together my own 
								website!
