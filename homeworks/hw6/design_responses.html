						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The optimal speed for interface animations is between 200ms to 500ms. Animation speed should be 
								catered to different devices. Keep physical laws in mind when objects collide. Do not use 
								motion blur when creating animations. Linear motion is unnatural and can be jarring to a user.
								A path of a moving object should coincide with the main axis rather than against it. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed the pretty animations! It was interesting to compare and contrast the "good" 
								animations and the "bad" animations. I wanted to see if I could figure out what was wrong 
								with the "bad" animations without reading the explanation. Innately, there was something wrong,
								but it was difficult to explain why. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "the animation in the interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world - friction, acceleration, etc.  </p>
						</li>
