        <p>Hi! I'm a third year Canadian student at UC Berkeley that combined his
            love of technology with his wonder of the life sciences.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, ultimate frisbee, and 
            Valorant!

        <strong>My favorite restaurants at Berkeley:</strong>

            <li>Party Sushi</li>
            <li>Mezzo's</li>
            <li>Racha Cafe</li>
        </ul>

            <li>I learned about for essential tenets of design: hierarchy, content, intent, and audience. I've always viewed design as 
                a study of making things aesthetically pleasing. I have not considered the potential consequences of design choices when
                it comes to designing an app for a wide variety of users, and what questions a designer has to consider.

            <li>My favorite part of the article was definitely the deconstructed app GIFs. I've never thought about the apps I use on a
                daily basis with a focus on design. It also prompted me to think about how apps like Instagram have evolved in design over the years. 
                Remember when everyone lost their mind over the rainbow logo and the white focused UI? Now, it's indisputably better than the old design
