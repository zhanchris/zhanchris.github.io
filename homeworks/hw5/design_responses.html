                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that there are many possibilities for design that I haven't previously considered. For example, animating the text falling apart 
                                when you click on a search bar or making your animations more lively. I also learned that this is a great website for getting design
                                inspiration. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really just enjoyed watching the animations on loop. I liked the examples of responsive web design, as it gave me ideas of how I could
                                potentially incorporate ideas into my own website, when I eventually do build it. I also enjoyed the variety of design examples. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I enjoyed the travel map the most. I liked how the search bar was animated to give you predicted responses which gives the user a sense of exploration.
                                I also liked how as the user typed a specific location, other locations were ruled out by literal text strike throughs, giving the user a sense of certainty 
                                for their trip! Finally, I enjoyed that there are images of popular landmarks for the destination located at the bottom of the app, giving the user more options to explore
                                near their destination. 
                            </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 5. I think some commentary on what is effective about each of the design choices would have been nice. </p>
