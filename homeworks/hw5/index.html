					I don't have a disability or know what it is like to live with one. I always knew that developing with accessibility in mind was important, but I didn't know what specific actions I could
					do during development to increase accessibility. Now I know that my background-to-text contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1. I also learned that I could incorporate accessibility 
					messages for errors during form entry and even modify how color is displayed on my website to ensure that users can always distinguish between colorful blocks.
				</p>
				<p>
					My favorite part of this article is actually that they reference tools that I can use when creating websites, such as Colorable, Colorsafe and InVision Craft. It's one thing to write
					an article about improving accessibility from color, but actually providing links to tools that I can immediately use is a great way for me to begin incorporating the practices the article 
					recommends. I also enjoyed the examples that made the choices of color contrast clear.
